## Contributions

Contributing to the Open Liberty Space Rover Mission is simple. To contribute, just fork from the `prod` branch.  Then create a branch in your forked repository to include your contribution and open a pull request to the `main` branch .
Certify the originality of your work by following the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org) approach and adding a line to the end of the Git commit message to sign your work:

```text
Signed-off-by: Jane Williams <jane.williams@gmail.com>
```

The sign-off is just a line at the end of the commit message that certifies that you wrote it or otherwise have the right to pass it on as an open source patch.

Use your real name when you sign. We can't accept pseudonyms or anonymous contributions.

Many Git UI tools have support for adding the `Signed-off-by` line to the end of your commit message. This line can be automatically added by the `git commit` command by using the `-s` option.

The team is then notified and your contribution is reviewed according to the following process:

1. The team will review your change(s).
    - If there are further changes to be made, the team will request changes on the pull request.
    - If the team does not agree with the change, the PR will be closed with an explanation and suggestion for follow-up.
2. If the team approves, the team will merge your PR. A full Open Liberty staging site build will be run.
3. Based on the results of the build:
    - If further review is needed, we will let you know about a pending review from our team and discuss any necessary improvements that need to be made to your change(s).
    - If everything is successful, the team will publish your change(s) to the `prod` branch and update the Open Liberty production site, if necessary.
